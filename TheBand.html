        <b>Officer Commanding Scottish Military Ball</b>
        <br>
        "Thank you for an impressive array of music for The Scottish Military Ball hosted at The Sheraton Grand on Saturday evening. Your playing was enjoyed by all our dancers.
        The folk attending the ball have wide and varied dancing abilities, from those that are quite proficient all the way through  to absolute beginners.
        It was very encouraging to see that everyone was catered for by the callers."
        <br><br>

        <b>Gladys Wall, SWRI Currie and Balerno News</b>
        <br>
        "We were certainly not disappointed with the entertainment provided by the Auld Spice Ceilidh Band.
        This was toe-tapping, hand clapping, sing-along music, very much enjoyed by all who attended.
        I would have no hesitation in recommending the group to anyone interested..."
        <br><br>

        <b>Elaine M. Bell, organiser for Gorgie Salvation Army Over 60 Club</b>
        <br>
        "Thank you very much for a great afternoon... the band performed a great and varied programme and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
        My own favourite was Ted performing 'The Shoals of Herrin' - that brought a lump to my throat...
        I will be in touch when compiling next year's syllabus."

        <b>Extract from letter</b>
        <br>
        "This is just a short note to say a very heartflet thank-you to the band for the excellent entertainment that you provided at Ann's party last Saturday night.  
        The mood of the night was set by the band and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves thoroughly.  
        It is often the case at such events that people have to prised from their seats to reluctantly take to the floor but his did not appear to be the case on Saturday.  <br>
        Many of Ann's cousins from down south have spoken of nothing else but the splendid music which was 
        provided but I suspect that many will take a long time to recover from the Orcadian Strip the Willow.  
        Wiser, more experienced souls such as you and I know when to avoid the dance floor!  
        Seriously though you helped make for a spledid evening .........I will of course be more than delighted to recommend you to anyone seeking a ceilidh band in the future"
