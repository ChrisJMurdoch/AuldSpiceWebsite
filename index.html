          <b>Officer Commanding Scottish Military Ball-</b>
          <br>
          "Thank you for an impressive array of music for The Scottish Military Ball hosted at The Sheraton Grand on Saturday evening. Your playing was enjoyed by all our dancers.
          The folk attending the ball have wide and varied dancing abilities, from those that are quite proficient all the way through  to absolute beginners.
          It was very encouraging to see that everyone was catered for by the callers."

          <b>Elaine M. Bell, organiser for Gorgie Salvation Army Over 60 Club-</b>

          "Thank you very much for a great afternoon... the band performed a great and varied programme and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
          My own favourite was Ted performing 'The Shoals of Herrin' - that brought a lump to my throat...
          I will be in touch when compiling next year's syllabus."

          "We were certainly not disappointed with the entertainment provided by the Auld Spice Ceilidh Band.
          This was toe-tapping, hand clapping, sing-along music, very much enjoyed by all who attended.
          I would have no hesitation in recommending the group to anyone interested..."

        Auld Spice Band is one of many groups and bands that owe their existence to the encouragement given in Scots 
        Music Group classes to go out and do something with the music they have learned as SMG students:
        Auld Spice was formed back when SMG was still part of the Adult Learning Project, and met in Downfield Place.
        They did their first live gig in 1997, so yes, the band is now 20 years old, and celebrating.
        Sadly however, some of the former members have gone to the big ceilidh band in the skies,
        and others have left for personal reasons:
        these include fiddlers Dick Rutter, Jim Coutts, Ann Cannon, Dave Gifford (also whistle), Kate Meek, Alec,
        keyboard players Margaret Ramsay and Peter Williams (also accordion, flute and bass guitar),
        drummer John Scott, Lowland piper and whistler Jim Buchanan, and Elizabeth on whistles.

        Nigel Gatherer and Seonaid Lynn have also guested with the band, and we have been lucky to have the following people as callers:
        John & Ruby Wilkinson, John Watkins, Janet Johnston and Christine McIntosh.
        The band still includes some founder members, and current line-up is: fiddlers Anna McFadden,
        John Robertson and Claire Murdoch (also whistle), accordion Allan Gray, flute Donald Easton, drums Tom Bullimore,
        concertina Ted Tracey-Bower and keyboard Trish Santer.

        We play for all sorts of gigs, not only ceilidhs but Care Homes and Day Centres.
        Our biggest one of the year is the Military Ball in the Assembly Rooms in George St, a challenging venue to play!
        We also played for the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry Ball at Blair Castle in November 2015:
        that was a sair fecht getting home through heavy snow!
