          <b>Officer Commanding Scottish Military Ball-</b>
          <br>
          "Thank you for an impressive array of music for The Scottish Military Ball hosted at The Sheraton Grand on Saturday evening. Your playing was enjoyed by all our dancers.
          The folk attending the ball have wide and varied dancing abilities, from those that are quite proficient all the way through  to absolute beginners.
          It was very encouraging to see that everyone was catered for by the callers."

          <b>Elaine M. Bell, organiser for Gorgie Salvation Army Over 60 Club-</b>
          <br>
          "Thank you very much for a great afternoon... the band performed a great and varied programme and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
          My own favourite was Ted performing 'The Shoals of Herrin' - that brought a lump to my throat...
          I will be in touch when compiling next year's syllabus."

          <b>Gladys Wall, SWRI Currie and Balerno News-</b>
          <br>
          "We were certainly not disappointed with the entertainment provided by the Auld Spice Ceilidh Band.
          This was toe-tapping, hand clapping, sing-along music, very much enjoyed by all who attended.
          I would have no hesitation in recommending the group to anyone interested..."
